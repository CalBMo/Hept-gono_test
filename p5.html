        <h3>SATURDAY, JULY [REDACTED], [REDACTED]</h3>
        <h6>Statement #9421050 by [REDACTED].</h6>
        <h3>Expedition Summary:</h3>
        <p>[REDACTED]</p>
        <h3>Log 0.:</h3>
        <h6>&lt;8 P.M. Wind blowing a strong gale&gt;</h6>
        <p>Arrived on board about 1:30 P.M. and found everything and everybody on board O.K.</p>
        <p>The following is the complete list of the members of the expedition:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>In addition, there were several who were to go only as far as our southern headquarters, as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>[REDACTED] – Philadelphia, PA. Artist.</li>

            <li>[REDACTED] (Maid and cook).</li>
            <li>[REDACTED] (Lieutenant's servant).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In charge of [REDACTED] "WinterBears" of St. Johns, [REDACTED].:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>[REDACTED] – Master.</li>
            <li>[REDACTED] – 1st Mate.</li>
            <li>[REDACTED] – 2nd Mate.</li>

            <li>[REDACTED] – Cook.</li>
            <li>A crew of 14 seamen.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Ship</h3>
        <p>“WinterBears" is one of the strongest as well as the fastest of the sealing fleet and is the property of [REDACTED]. of St. Johns, Newfoundland.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gross tonnage: 458</li>
            <li>Net tonnage: 311</li>
            <li>Horsepower: 80</li>
            <li>Speed: 9 knots</li>
            <li>Dimensions:</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Length: 160 ft.</li>
            <li>Beam: 26 ft.</li>
            <li>Depth of hold: 17 ft. 2 in.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Log 1 – Log 176.:</h3>
        <p>[REDACTED]</p>
        <h3>Log 177.:</h3>
        <h6>&lt;3 A.M. No wind blowing&gt;</h6>
        <p>The strange music persists, echoing through the corridors like a haunting melody. The emergency power has completely failed, leaving us in near-total darkness. [REDACTED] claims the ship’s computer has been speaking to him, reciting coordinates and cryptic phrases. We suspect the isolation and stress are taking their toll. [REDACTED] has been relieved of duty and placed under observation until further notice.</p>
        <p>No significant changes in weather or morale. The crew is growing restless.</p>
        <h3>Log 178 – Log 183.:</h3>
        <p>[REDACTED]</p>
        <h3>Log 184.:</h3>
        <h6>&lt;5 P.M. No wind blowing&gt;</h6>
        <p>Tragedy has struck. [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] are presumed dead. Their bodies were committed to the sea in a somber ceremony. The nights are unnaturally short, and the cold is relentless. We’ve lost track of time entirely. Supplies are dwindling, and the heater has failed. This morning, [REDACTED] leapt overboard without warning, and [REDACTED] has retreated into silence, refusing to speak or acknowledge anyone.</p>
        <p>The music continues, growing louder and more dissonant. It seems to emanate from nowhere and everywhere at once. The ship feels like a tomb.</p>
        <h3>Log 185 – Log 212.:</h3>
        <p>[REDACTED]</p>
        <h3>Log 212.:</h3>
        <p>Only three of us remain. The others are gone, their faces still haunting me in the shadows. The music—if it can even be called that—now seems to come from the mouths of the dead, their lifeless forms drifting alongside the ship. The cold is unbearable, seeping into our very bones. I’ve lost all sense of time; days and nights blur together in an endless cycle of despair.</p>
        <p>The ship’s computer is the only device still operational, yet it’s disconnected from any power source. It displays messages I cannot comprehend, symbols and patterns that seem to shift when I look away. I can no longer bring myself to interact with it.</p>
        <p>This will be my final entry. The expedition has failed. We are alone, adrift in a frozen wasteland that feels like the edge of the world. If anyone finds this log, know that we fought until the very end.</p>
        <h3>Expedition Conclusions:</h3>
        <p>The data collected is incomplete and inconclusive. The anomalies encountered defy explanation. Further investigations are to be ceased.</p>
        <h3>Last Contact.:</h3>
        <p>All communication ceased on [REDACTED]. No response from headquarters.</p>
        <h3>Remaining Crew.:</h3>
        <p>None</p>
