        <h3>Recording Log – [REDACTED]</h3>
        <h6>Statement #4105335 recovered from the entrance of the abandoned subway tunnel beneath [REDACTED] on [REDACTED], dated as Januray 14, [REDACTED].</h6>
        
        <h3>RECORDING BEGINS</h3>

        <p><em>[Click. A faint rustling sound. A deep breath.]</em></p>

        <p>"Okay. Uh... January 14th. Today's supposed to be a fun day!"</p>

        <p>"I’m here with my friends. We finally worked up the nerve to do something we’ve talked about forever: urban exploration."</p>

        <p>"We’re already used to running around high places, jumping rooftops, all that, parkour is kinda our thing. But I wanted more. Something deeper, you know what I mean."</p>

        <p>"There's this abandoned tunnel in the city. It was meant to be part of a subway station, but they scrapped the project. No idea why. Now it’s just a hangout spot for people like us. No cops, no homeless people, no loose metal ready to take someone’s head off. Pretty safe."</p>

        <p>"Well, we found something a couple of days ago. A gap in the barricade. The place was never sealed off properly so there’s a way through. A connection to the rest of the tunnels."</p>

        <p>"We’ve got everything we need: flashlights, water, coats, all that. We’re at the entrance now. It’s... yeah, it’s dark. Damp. Feels colder than it should. But the tunnel’s wide, at least. Room to breathe. I’m good."</p>

        <p>"We’re going in."</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p>"Okay… We made it past the entrance. It- it’s fine. It’s fine. The tunnel’s wide enough. Feels almost normal, like an unfinished basement or something. Smells like wet concrete."</p>

        <p>"Mick’s ahead of me. He’s shining his flashlight around like he’s in a damn horror movie. Kyle’s right behind him, cracking joke- shut up, Kyle, you’re not funny! And Justin, I swear to God, is still chewing on that stupid cereal bar. Dude always eats when he’s nervous."</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p>"Alright. This is where it gets interesting. We’re at the connection. The part they didn’t seal properly. It’s… way tighter than I thought. Like, we have to crawl through this. Okay. Okay, that’s fine."</p>

        <p>"I’m going first."</p>

        <p><em>[Rustling sounds. A faint scraping noise.]</em></p>

        <p>"Christ, it’s small in here. I can barely move my arms. Just… pulling myself forward with my elbows. It smells different, too. Stale. Like air that’s been sitting here for decades."</p>

        <p>"Mick’s right behind me, telling me to hurry up. Yeah, yeah, I’m going! Justin’s cursing ‘cause he got stuck for a second."</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p>"I can see the end. There’s a maintenance room or something up ahead—some kind of storage space. Almost there."</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p>"Alright. We’re in."</p>

        <p>"What the hell…? This place is packed! Boxes everywhere. Metal bars stacked against the walls. Feels like a... like a twisted jungle gym or something. This is crazy, I have to squeeze between stuff just to move. My light keeps catching weird shadows... ugh, let’s just get out of here."</p>

        <p>"Okay, this leads into—wait. What?"</p>

        <p>"This doesn’t look like the subway..."</p>

        <p>"No tracks. Just a tunnel that goes... somewhere."</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p>"I- okay. This is weird."</p>

        <p>"We took a few turns, and the tunnel just keeps going. No tracks, no signs, nothing. Just dust. So much dust. Every step kicks it up into the air, feels like it’s sticking to my throat."</p>

        <p>"The ceiling’s lower now. I have to hunch a little. Not a fan of that. But it’s fine. We’ll double back soon."</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p>"Wait… hold on."</p>

        <p>"Where are they?"</p>

        <p>"What the hell!? Where are they?!"</p>

        <p>"I swear- I swear they were right behind me. I could hear them. Mick and Kyle were talking. Justin was chewing like a damn cow. But- but now… nothing?"</p>

        <p>"No footsteps. No voices."</p>

        <p>"Just me."</p>

        <p>"Okay. Okay, it’s fine. They probably just took a wrong turn. I’ll call them."</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p><em>[Beep. Beep. Silence.]</em></p>

        <p>"No signal. Of course..."</p>

        <p>"Mick! Kyle! Justin!"</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p>"Wait. Wait, no, this- this isn’t right."</p>

        <p>"Where the hell did all these turns come from? This wasn’t here before!"</p>

        <p>"Okay. Okay, stop. Just- stop."</p>

        <p>"Think."</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p>"I’ll leave a mark! Right, like- boyscouts thing! Of- of course! This- this needs to work, this- I need this to work. My flashlight’s got a weak beam- I’ll draw an arrow in the dust..."</p>

        <p><em>[Scraping sound.]</em></p>
        
        <p>"There."</p>

        <p>"Now, just… keep going. Leave the marks. I’ll find my way back."</p>

        <p>"I just have to—"</p>

        <p><em>[Thud. A sharp intake of breath.]</em></p>

        <p>"Shit! I tripped- no, no, my flashlight-"</p>

        <p><em>[Clattering sound. Silence.]</em></p>

        <p>"...no."</p>

        <p>"No no no no- where’s my flashlight? I just- I just, I can't see the marks!"</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p>"It’s gone..."</p>

        <p>"Like It was never here..."</p>

        <p>"No. No, this- this doesn’t make sense. I don’t-"</p>

        <p><em>[A faint rumbling sound.]</em></p>

        <p>"...What was that?"</p>

        <p>"Fuck I need to keep moving, god dammint!</p>

        <p>"The ground- it’s... soft? No, no, that’s not right, it was solid a second ago-"</p>

        <p>"Okay. Okay, I just need to... move..."</p>

        <p>"Just... MOVE, FOR FUCK SAKE KEEP MOVING WHY-"</p>

        <p>"My foot-"</p>

        <p>"It’s sinking."</p>

        <p>"No. No no no NO NO NOT RIGHT NOW! This isn’t- this isn’t happening!"</p>

        <p>"It’s pulling me down!"</p>

        <p>"The floor- it’s- ITS FUCKING PULLING ME DOWN!"</p>

        <p>"MICK! KYLE! JUSTIN! PLEASE!"</p>

        <p>"SOMEBODY PULL ME OUT!"</p>

        <p>"I can't-..."</p>

        <p>"I can't breath-"</p>

        <p>EN - It's basically the things that make you feel small, insignificant. Big spaces, where you're nothing, very small spaces where you can barely move. The fear of heights, claustrophobia, thalassophobia, the fear os big structures and big creatures, existential dread and all that. It's the feeling an astronaut feels when looking at space outside its ship, or a coal miners fear of being buried alive inside the mountain it carves, or the dumb miljonair who makes its own submarine and get swallowed alive by the vast sea around it. It works well with other fears, as it relies a lot on its environment.</p>
        <p>PT - São basicamente as coisas que fazem você se sentir pequeno, insignificante. Grandes espaços, onde você não é nada, espaços muito pequenos onde você mal consegue se mover. O medo de altura, claustrofobia, talassofobia, o medo de grandes estruturas e grandes criaturas, pavor existencial e tudo isso. É a sensação que um astronauta sente ao olhar para o espaço fora de sua nave, ou o medo de um mineiro de carvão de ser enterrado vivo dentro da montanha que ele esculpe, ou o milionário idiota que faz seu próprio submarino e é engolido vivo pelo vasto mar ao seu redor. Funciona bem com outros medos, pois depende muito de seu ambiente.</p>
