            It's been about three years since I've moved in with Armina, I changed my appearance, and well, I look older anyways. I've been able to keep the research going and the Simulacrum haven't been able to find me since. Yesterday Armina had an idea, just to be sure we wouldn't be bothered, of forging my death. Today we threw a car into a ditch and threw it on fire. I made sure to leave my ID and some of my stuff in there, just in the right place for someone to recognize. I'll keep the Simulacrum ID, but the rest is gone. I'll keep the research going and get myself some new documents.

        <div class="entry-title">[RECOVERED LOG - ███] Theory of The 7 Fears</div>
        <div class="entry-content">
            Been researching more fear related theories and I'm putting this here just for the record, even if It applies more to the corporate world. It was developed by Jansei Demartini and says the seven fears revolve around different aspects of life that can hold a person back from growth and fulfillment. The fear of not knowing enough can lead to hesitation in pursuing opportunities due to self-doubt about one's intelligence or expertise. Similarly, the fear of failure in a career can prevent individuals from taking risks necessary for success. Financial insecurity, or the fear of losing money, may keep people trapped in unfulfilling jobs rather than following their passions. The fear of losing the respect of loved ones can cause individuals to conform to expectations rather than embracing their true selves, just as the fear of social rejection discourages authenticity and bold action. Doubts about physical capability or appearance can hinder confidence in both personal and professional pursuits. Lastly, the fear of breaking moral or ethical codes imposed by authority figures may create inner conflict, making it difficult to challenge societal norms or carve a unique path in life. Understanding these fears allows for conscious effort to overcome them, leading to greater personal empowerment... But not really anything paranormal in this.

            <p>First log... Good to keep track of progress I guess, even if I'm already getting tired of writting. Ha, who am I kidding, this'll be my life for the forseable future, need to try and enjoy it.</p>
            <p>Okay, from the beggining, I'm █████ ███████, lead researcher of the Simulacrum Inc. and today, the date that marks the start, is ██/██/█████, ██:██. This is a personal project with the intention of studying and documenting my finds on paranormal activities and possible magic related issues. It's not so different to what we do normally, but... I'm trying to go deeper than my job let's me right now, that's why this is top secret content. My relationship with the rest of the crew is already going downhill ever since I started practicing the occult, so yeah, let's hope no one finds out about this.</p>
            <p>The system is a modified computer, I used a recent computer monitor hollowed out to fit all the components. I got some boards and electronic parts while online shopping, a tape recorder/player/modified editor and transcriptor mounted to the side, the monitor of the already existing computer monitor, the mouse and keyboard from my office and this card reador so I can use my Simulacrum ID as a possible entry to this.</p>
            <p>It's a mess, but it's my mess. I'm proud of it.</p>
            <p>Welp, that's all for today, I'll try to keep this updated as much as I can. Next log I'll try and organize my knowledge on the mythical stuff I've studied.</p>

            <p>Okay for the first log I'll start with something that I'm really not that interested in going too in depth, mainly cause it's gotten sooo mainstream.</p>
            <p>The topic is Astrology, the belief in the relation between celestial observations and terrestrial events and that they have influenced various aspects of human history, including world-views, language and many elements of culture. It's an area of studies that has existed since the beggining of times, being believed to have started as soon as humanity looked up to the sky. It has been showed time after time how certain days of the week, certain star alignment moments and stuff like that influence the occurance of occult stuff, so I can say this form of studies has it's bases, but at the same time it's hard to put all the "blame" in an explanation as simples as: It was the stars.</p>
            <p>I studied a lot of different Astrology related rituals and ceremonies, and they all seem very interested but not really what I was looking for. Bellow I'll pin a link to another part of the log's specific for my Astrology studies.</p>

            <p>Continuing on, this will be all about Alchemy. It is is an ancient branch of natural philosophy, a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that was historically practised in China, India, the Muslim world, and Europe. It's all about transformation, purification, transmutation and perfection of certain materials, but it has evolved a long way after that. Some people still practice it now-a-days, not me tho, don't have the right equipments and, to be honest I don't have a lot of interest in it.</p>

            <div class="entry-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>This is a category made by Robert Smirke, who categorised fears into 14 different entities. Each entity is comprised of a variety of smaller terrors, some direct, some abstract, and some tend to bleed over between one entity and the next. Whilst fears do change and are subject to place, time, and culture, they are thought to have remained fairly stable since the industrial revolution, which makes me very intrigued by the research made. He theorised an entity's power fluctuates with the world's fear of their domain, and that each entity has a variety of names. Though Smirke's names are generally a good way to think of things, it's not the most commonly used.</p>
            <p>I haven't seen a lot of informations on this online and all the places that could have some, don't seem to like to make contact, so It'll be hard to decide how reliable this is. Nonetheless, I'll leave a brief explanation of every entity and how he describes it bellow, as always. And I'll keep in mind his theory... I think it's a good basis for my own work.</p>

            <div class="entry-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>This was developed by Raphael Lange, a big researcher and occultist. He took a different approach and went a bit more broad on its approach, dividing all paranormal things into 5 categories. They are blood, knowledge, death, energy and fear. Once again, a good basis, and it seems to be liked by a lot of researchers. I've found myself very intrigued by it, but... I don't know, It's like something keeps calling for me...</p>
            <p>Anyways, he says that fear is what bring the paranormal from "The Other Side" to our reality, making the veil that separetes us, from them, weaker and more unstable. It makes sense, as it seems like the more someone fears something, the bigger the control that thing has over their life. Once again, you know the deal.</p>

            <div class="entry-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>Okay, this is a big one. Magic Circles are a form of ritual that is used to contain and control the spiritual energy of a ritual. They are used to create a sacred space, to protect the practitioner from negative influences, and to provide a focus for the practitioner's energy. They are often used in conjunction with other magical tools, such as wands, athames, and candles, to enhance the power of the ritual.</p>
            <p>There are many different types of magic circles, each with its own specific purpose and design. Some are used to invoke spirits or deities, others are used to banish negative energies, and still others are used to create a protective barrier around the practitioner. The most common type of magic circle is the protective circle, which is used to create a barrier between the practitioner and any negative influences that may be present during the ritual.</p>
            <p>There are many different ways to create a magic circle, but the most common method is to draw a circle on the ground using a wand or athame. The circle is then consecrated with salt, water, or incense, and the practitioner stands inside the circle while performing the ritual. The circle is then closed by drawing a line across the circle with the wand or athame, and the practitioner is free to leave the circle once the ritual is complete.</p>
            <p>The nature of the magic circle makes it so every. single. magic. type. uses it in a way or another. I've added some simbols and magic circles to previous entries, and I'll add here some other examples, as well as a more in depth research on the topic.</p>

            <div class="entry-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>Runes are the letters in a set of related alphabets known as runic alphabets, which were used to write various Germanic languages before the adoption of the Latin alphabet and for specialised purposes thereafter. The Scandinavian variants are also known as futhark or fuþark (derived from their first six letters of the alphabet: F, U, Þ, A, R, and K); the Anglo-Saxon variant is futhorc or fuþorc (due to sound changes undergone in Old English by the names of the first six runes).</p>
            <p>Historically, runes were used for divination and magic, in addition to writing. The word "rune" itself comes from an early Anglo-Saxon word meaning "secret" or "mystery", and it is believed that the symbols were originally used as a form of magical writing, designed to protect the user from harm and to bring good fortune.</p>
            <p>There are many different types of runes, each with its own specific meaning and purpose. Some are used for divination, others for protection, and still others for healing. The most common type of rune is the Elder Futhark, which is used for divination and magic. I've been studying the runes for a while now, and I've found them to be a powerful tool for self-discovery and personal growth. I'll leave some examples of runes bellow, as well as a more in depth research on the topic.</p>

            <div class="entry-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>I've been experimenting with some things... Based on all the research I've made this far, I think I have a pretty good basis to actually start the project. It's been ██ months since I've started this, and I don't think there's a better time then now. It's currently ██:██ on a ██████, which means the full moon will be perfectly aligned with ████████ and ██████. Also, I've started developing the symbol, like I said on [Log - 003], it needs to be perfect. I've combined a lot of the things I learned, specially from the "Studies" Logs of [LOG - 004], [LOG - 007], [LOG - 008] and [LOG - 010]. </p>
            <p>I'm dividing the symbol in seven different sections, each corresponding to a type of "fear". I really beleive in the power that comes from this, and the feelings related to this, so I'll use it as the starting point. I'll get this website in the world wide web as the Simulacrum System and hope the urban legend grows. If they believe, or better yet, fear the information I display, things will flow much easier. I'm still very early on my research, other than the number of entities I know nothing about what to put there, but thats good... I'll update the website as time goes on. I think that If I make this right, gather enought information and, well, actually perfect the ritual, I might be up to something really special.</p>
            <p>I've also started gathering statements from various places for each section. It's been hard to find those I actually believe happened, cause, you know, it's hard to get things documenting paranormal activities. I'll spend the next couple of weeks perfecting the symbols and describing the process here, after that I'll focus on the statements then I'll think about actually making the ritual.</p>

            <p>Welp, this time I've actually been fired. I've seen this coming, since the past week... Well, I did what I had to do to get that information, a shame ██████ had to die in the process. But yeah they elected a new Mirage, her name is ██████████ and that bitch almost killed me in the process. And if that wasn't enough, she did it with my sword, MY OWN FUCKING WEAPON against me, and she kept it... I swear one day I'll get it back. At least I got to move my setup somewhere else before shit hit the fan, with only the Randúlfr brothers seeing. I don't think they knew what was going on because they didn't try to stop me. This will make my job a lot harder, but I think I've made a name for myself online already... The plan needs to work, the show must go on.</p>

        <p>Okay, so I've been having some problems with the system. I think it's because of the amount of information I've been storing in it, but I'm not sure. I've been trying to fix it, but it's been hard. I think I'll need to get some help with this, but I don't know who to ask. I'll keep trying to fix it, but I don't know how long it will take. I'll keep you updated on my progress.</p>

        <div class="entry-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>They REALLY want me dead, like, REALLY! The fuckers over at Simulacrum are sending sooo many peopple to follow my trail, It's been impossible to keep the researches, statements and all that in order at the same time that I'm running around, moving from place to place in hopes of finally setting in. I think the website already gathered enough fear to it, I can feel the system... alive. It's been complete with all the seven informations, statements and all that for some months now and I've read in some horror stories forums about the Simulacrum System, a Creepypasta about a computer system that could communicate with a dimension higher than ours, as if breaking the fourth wall of reality, but little by little it became the catalyst that broke reality entirely, turning the world into a hellish nightmare. Not that far away from the truth, what makes it even better.</p>
        <p>I've found a very intersting place too... I dont think I should go settle there right now, as I've been followed around the city, but soon enough I'll make a visit. It's called ████████, and it's a place where the paranormal is said to be very strong. Since it's an orphanage runned by a young lady I've met before, maybe I'll be able to convince her to stay there for a while... What was her name again? I think it was something like Armina Felícia, I'll make some research on her later.</p>

        <p>It's been some weeks since my last Log, but I've been able to move in with Armina. I'm very happy she still recognized me and well, she has a lot of common interests with me. She seems very interested in the occult and maybe, just maybe, she'd help me with this. Even if she doesn't, it's still good to have a place to stay, safe.</p>
        <p>I'll spend the next week talking to her, I'll update here if anything else happens.</p>

        <p> It's been almost a month since I said I'd talk to her. In the mean time I worked on a lot of things, mostly statement transcriptions and system maintanance, It's a miracle this thing is still working... It's almost... paranormal, haha. I think I have enough statements so I'll change my focus to outside the system. I was able to manipulate Armina into wanting to do the ritual with me, she believes it's for a good cause and... well... it still is for a good cause, just not the one she thinks it is. She doesn't need to know. I'll keep updating here with informations about how things go, but now comes the part that could take the longest: finding the marked people...</p>

        <p> I'm █████ ███████, ex head director and lead researcher of the old Simulacrum Inc, now Ordo Simulacrum, and current solo researcher of the Héptagram theory. Today, the date that marks the last Log made, is ██/██/█████, ██:██. Armina and the rest of our kids are setting everything up. I can't believe how far we've come... The book I was writing on the Héptagram is complete, I've made two copies, one for her to make the ritual, one for me for after it's complete. I'll spare you the details but I'm very proud of how it is. My lifes work, years of effort, all for this! I'll stop updating the system, even if I know It wont shut down. I've noticed for some years now that It developed a mind of its own, and I couldn't be more happy about it. It wont be the center of the ritual anymore, but after it is complete, I'm certain I'll come back to check on it.</p>
        <p> Here's all the info I've gathered for the past ██ years on this compiled and organized, a final Studie, one I've developed...</p>
