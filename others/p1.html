        <p>DISPATCHER: "911, what's your emergency?"</p>
        <p>CALLER: "H-hello? Police? Can you hear me?"</p>
        <p>DISPATCHER: "Yes, this is the police. I can hear you. Are you safe? What's happening?"</p>
        <p>CALLER: "There's this, uhh, how can I say it... I think it's a person. It's been looking at my house for the last hour or so..."</p>
        <p>DISPATCHER: "Alright, I understand. Stay calm. Where exactly are you right now? Are you inside your house?"</p>
        <p>CALLER: "Yes, I'm in my bedroom right now. Everything’s locked, I checked. But I can't help feeling unsafe here..."</p>
        <p>DISPATCHER: "You're doing the right thing by staying inside with everything locked. Can you describe this person to me? What do they look like? Are they standing still, moving, or doing anything unusual?"</p>
        <p>CALLER: "It's... tall and thin and kinda bent to the right, like, it doesn’t seem right... I can't see its face— if it even has one, and one leg seems to—oh fuck... One leg is definitely much shorter than the other..."</p>
        <p>DISPATCHER: "Okay, I hear you. Stay calm and keep your voice low. You’re doing great. Is it moving at all, or just standing there? And where exactly is it? Front yard? Back? How close to your house?"</p>
        <p>CALLER: "It's in... It... My front yard... I know it's my front yard 'cause my window's only view is... but... there's something wrong here... It doesn’t look like it, it doesn’t look like anywhere in specific, what in the worl- where the fuck am I righ—Oh fuck, it is moving!"</p>
        <p>DISPATCHER: "Listen to me. Stay where you are. Do NOT look away, but do NOT go near it. Keep your breathing steady. Help is on the way. Tell me exactly what it's doing. How is it moving? Toward the house? Away? Describe it as best you can!"</p>
        <p>CALLER: "He—It, it has hair on all the places you would expect, except on the places it doesn’t... It has an eye, maybe two, a face could be there but I can't tell. Its legs are just long enough for its feet to reach the ground, and on the edge of its arms there are... hands? Or just fingers... It's like a person, but modeled poorly by someone who only ever saw another person once... And, everything around it seems to be just as wrong... The car on the street, it's... it's fucking cardboard, drawn. There are no trees... I don’t think I'm looking at my front yard anymore... It's movign towards me... Holy shit it is so slow... So fucking unsetly... OH GOD I THINK IT'S LOOKING AT ME NOW..."</p>
        <p>DISPATCHER: "Okay. Okay. You're doing great. I need you to stay with me, alright? You're still inside your room, correct? Everything is still locked?"</p>
        <p>CALLER: "My room... My room... This is not- Where am I..? Its NOT my fucking room FUCK! No no nonono NO NO IT'S HERE! HOW’D IT GET INSI—"</p>

    <!-- Section 3: A Lot of Text -->
    <section id="text">
        <p>EN - The Uncanny, not present only in places but also in people, objects, anything that just… seem a bit odd. It’s the fear of the almost-known, the fear of dolls, clowns, wax models, taxidermies and mannequins, also those strange liminal spaces you walk by once and think “have I ever been here before?” even though no, you’ve never been there. It’s unsettling, it's the lack of identity, in some cases the lack of people or things that would make sense to be there, it’s a fear that can a lot of times feel lonely and isolating. It seems to play with reality, changing things just a bit every time until you just can’t seem to put a finger on what was there before the change. Very confusing, very unsettling.</p>
        <p>PT - O Inquietante, não presente apenas em lugares, mas também em pessoas, objetos, qualquer coisa que simplesmente... pareça um pouco estranha. É o medo do quase-conhecido, o medo de bonecas, palhaços, modelos de cera, taxidermias e manequins, também aqueles esquisitos espaços liminares pelos quais você passa uma vez e pensa "eu já estive aqui antes?" mesmo que não, você nunca esteve lá. É perturbador, é a falta de identidade, em alguns casos a falta de pessoas ou coisas que fariam sentido estar lá, é um medo que pode muitas vezes parecer solitário e isolante. Isso parece brincar com a realidade, mudando as coisas um pouco de cada vez até que você simplesmente não consegue colocar o dedo no que estava lá antes da mudança. Muito confuso, muito perturbador.</p>
