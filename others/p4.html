        <p>"Partner, it's been following me... This thing... You won't believe an old pall like me talking but I can assure you it's all true. It has really been following me, I call it thing cause no animal I ever put my eyes on look like it. Things closer to a chupacabra than anything. It's freaking terrifying! The type of naked and meaty 
            distorted thing that would make a young fella like you lose it's mind just by looking at it haha. Too many teeth, too big of a claw, stalking from the distance like a little bitch. It's preying on me, I can feel it. Me and my nag. Like a freaking animal, I feel like a prey and that dog-freak is running in 
            circles around me. It'll get me eventually If I keep this pace, don't know how long I got to run still, and I feel like it knows it... I'm in the middle of a hurricane, nowhere to go, only the silent and very possible demise that's all too near for comfort. How on mother 
            nature's name would a thing like that exist?! I've travelled the whole west, been put in a lot of worse positions... You know me right?! Imma show that varmint who the curly wolf is and shove some lead up it's skull! Just wanted to update you before leaving, its dark now and I hope to finish things before high noon hits. I'll send you all the tapes from the travel If I get out of this alive, but I wouldnt worry much If I were you cause I REFUSE be hunted WHEN I'M the one fucking hunting!"</p>

        <p>EN - It seems to be related to "uncontrollable" things, including natural disasters, the act of hunting and preying upon something/someone, the fear of eating and being eaten, body horror and other related issues in a way or another. Savage fears, fears that a lot of times feed on you before death, playing with its food. It seems to mutate people, make them hungry for action and really strong on its primal instincts. Also affecting animals, it's a really dangerous fear to go face to face, as it seems to like the confrontation too.</p>
        <p>PT - Parece estar relacionado a coisas "incontroláveis", incluindo desastres naturais, o ato de caçar e perseguir algo/alguém, o medo de comer e ser comido, horror corporal e outras questões relacionadas a isso de uma forma ou de outra. Medos selvagens, medos que muitas vezes se alimentam de você antes da morte, brincando com sua comida. Parece transformar as pessoas, torná-las famintas por ação e inclinadas a seguirem seus instintos primitivos. Também afetando animais, é um medo realmente perigoso de encarar cara a cara, pois parece gostar do confronto também.</p>
